        "### Q&A\n",
        "The model's performance has significantly improved, particularly in its precision for classifying 'spam'. Initially, the model produced 39 false negatives (actual spam classified as ham) and 0 false positives (actual ham classified as spam). After enhancing the TF-IDF vectorizer with N-grams and retraining, the model achieved perfect precision (1.00) for the 'spam' class, meaning that when it predicts a message is spam, it is always correct. Its recall for 'spam' is 0.70, indicating it identifies 70% of actual spam messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further steps could include:\n",
        "*   Investigating the remaining 30% of actual spam messages that are still being missed by the model (false negatives) to identify common characteristics or vocabulary that could be better captured.\n",
        "*   Experimenting with different N-gram ranges or more advanced text preprocessing techniques.\n",
        "*   Exploring other classification algorithms or ensemble methods to potentially improve recall for the 'spam' class without sacrificing the high precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The initial model misclassified 39 'spam' messages as 'ham' (false negatives) and had no 'ham' messages misclassified as 'spam' (false positives).\n",
        "*   Enhancing the TF-IDF vectorizer with N-grams (unigrams and bigrams) for text processing was successfully implemented.\n",
        "*   After retraining with N-grams, the model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.9598 on the test data.\n",
        "*   The retrained model demonstrated excellent performance for the 'ham' class, with a precision of 0.96, recall of 1.00, and F1-score of 0.98.\n",
        "*   For the 'spam' class, the model achieved a perfect precision of 1.00, meaning no legitimate 'ham' messages were incorrectly classified as 'spam'. However, the recall for 'spam' was 0.70, indicating that 30% of actual spam messages were still missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current model excels at avoiding false positives (classifying legitimate messages as spam), which is crucial for user experience. However, there's room to improve its ability to detect all spam (increase recall for 'spam').\n",
        "*   Future efforts should focus on analyzing the characteristics of the remaining 30% of undetected spam messages (false negatives) to further refine text features or explore alternative modeling approaches that can boost spam recall without negatively impacting the achieved high precision.\n"
